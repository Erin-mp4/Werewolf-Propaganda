<h3>And Iâ€™m not Kidding</h3>
<p>Of all the monsters popularized by old black-and-white Universal movies,
the vampire has reigned supreme for far too long. The concept of the
werewolf has existed in human consciousness for just as long, if not

century of vampire movies. This webpage acts as werewolf propaganda,
containing information on how the legend of the werewolf has grown
through historical folklore, written fiction, and movies.</p>

<td>From a term coined in the Roman empire, to accusations in the witch
trials, werewolves have been around for a <em>very</em> long time.</td>
<td>One of the earliest werewolves in fiction comes from supposedly
translated texts in the 12th century. And then one of them goes to Paris
in 1870.</td>
